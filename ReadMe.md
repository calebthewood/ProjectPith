# ProjectPith ReadMe

## Temp ReadMe

I expect Project Pith to be something of a monolithic service for my personal projects. Rather than spinning up and depoloying a new server each time I need a backend, I can add a new set of routes here. Eventually I'd like to get it a domain name and set it up somewhere long term. Should be fun :)

### Blog Posts

WIP - Resource for managing the blog on my personal site

### Twitter API

Planned - Fetch tweets to send to my personal site so I can do things like display my 100DaysOfCode in one list. I'll likely add other tags in the future.

### NumbersAPI

Planned - I would like to write an api for Numbers so that I can display facts during my loading screens. One caveat, may not be feasible to use AJAX for a loading component lol.

### Others?

I'm sure more things will pop up. A a general quote api would be nice to have. And More sophisticated stuff done the line too.
