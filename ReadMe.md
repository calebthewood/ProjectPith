# ProjectPith ReadMe

## Temp ReadMe

I expect Project Pith to be something of a monolithic service for my personal projects. Rather than spinning up and depoloying a new server each time I need a backend, I can add a new set of routes here. Eventually I'd like to get it a domain name and set it up somewhere long term. Should be fun :)

### Blog Posts

WIP - Resource for managing the blog on my personal site

### Twitter API

Planned - Fetch tweets to send to my personal site so I can do things like display my 100DaysOfCode in one list. I'll likely add other tags in the future.

### Hour Tracker with Twilio

Plan is to develop a SMS interface here, and a simple dashaboard on my personal site that allows me to track how many hours I spend doing various activites each hour. Idea is a response to my sinking 195 hours into TOTK, and is meant to gamify learning, project work, and other responsible behaviors. Will have high level categories for wasted time, projects, work, learning, hobbies, and exercise and subcategories to add specificity. For example, learning would have sub categories for books, courses, docs, new skills, existing skills, and hobbies might have subcategories for baking, or guitar. System will run with the cron library to schedule several tasks that run each day and each hour. Will update this again once it's built.

### NumbersAPI

Planned - I would like to write an api for Numbers so that I can display facts during my loading screens. One caveat, may not be feasible to use AJAX for a loading component lol.

### Others?

I'm sure more things will pop up. A a general quote api would be nice to have. And More sophisticated stuff done the line too.
