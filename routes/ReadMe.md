## Blog Routes

### Notes
- Using blog/routes for posterity. I think posts may be too generic a term. There may be other types of posts I'd like to add in the future and blogPosts seems to ugly. Subject to change...

- Needs more robust error handling and bug testing. It works now but anything unpredictable will break it pretty easily.

- Needs Querying endpoints to allow for front end querying.
